# Static Members in PHP

## Introduction

In PHP, static members (properties and methods) belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class. This means that you can access them without creating an instance of the class.

## Static Properties

Static properties are declared with the `static` keyword. They are shared among all instances of a class.

### Example 1

```php
class MyClass {
    public static $myStaticProperty = 'Hello, World!';
    
    public static function getStaticProperty() {
        return self::$myStaticProperty;
    }
}

// Accessing static property without creating an instance
echo MyClass::$myStaticProperty; // Outputs: Hello, World!
```

## Static Methods

Static methods are also declared with the `static` keyword. They can be called directly on the class without creating an instance.

### Example 2

```php
class MyClass {
    public static function myStaticMethod() {
        return 'Hello from static method!';
    }
}

// Calling static method without creating an instance
echo MyClass::myStaticMethod(); // Outputs: Hello from static method!
```

## Usage

Static members are useful when you need to store data or functionality that is shared across all instances of a class. They are commonly used for utility functions, constants, or counters.

## Conclusion

Static members in PHP provide a way to define class-level properties and methods. They can be accessed directly on the class itself, making them useful for shared data and functionality.
