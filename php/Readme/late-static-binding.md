# Static Binding in PHP

Static binding in PHP refers to the process of resolving the method calls, properties, and constants at compile time rather than at runtime. This is particularly useful for performance optimization and ensuring that the correct method or property is accessed.

## Example

Here is an example of static binding in PHP:

```php
<?php
class BaseClass {
    public static function staticMethod() {
        echo "BaseClass staticMethod\n";
    }

    public static function callStaticMethod() {
        static::staticMethod();
    }
}

class DerivedClass extends BaseClass {
    public static function staticMethod() {
        echo "DerivedClass staticMethod\n";
    }
}

DerivedClass::callStaticMethod(); // Outputs: DerivedClass staticMethod
?>
```

In this example, `static::staticMethod()` in the `BaseClass` will call the `staticMethod` of the `DerivedClass` due to static binding.

## Benefits

- **Performance**: Static binding can improve performance by resolving method calls at compile time.
- **Correctness**: Ensures that the correct method or property is accessed, especially in inheritance hierarchies.

## Conclusion

Static binding is a powerful feature in PHP that can help optimize performance and ensure correctness in your code. Understanding how and when to use it can greatly enhance your PHP programming skills.
