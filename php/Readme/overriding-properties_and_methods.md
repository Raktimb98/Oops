# Overriding Properties and Methods in PHP

## Introduction

In object-oriented programming, overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method or property that is already defined in its superclass. This is a powerful feature in PHP that enables polymorphism and code reuse.

## Overriding Methods

To override a method in PHP, you simply define a method in the subclass with the same name and parameters as the method in the superclass.

### Example 1

```php
class ParentClass {
    public function display() {
        echo "This is the parent class method.";
    }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    public function display() {
        echo "This is the child class method.";
    }
}

$child = new ChildClass();
$child->display(); // Outputs: This is the child class method.
```

## Overriding Properties

Overriding properties in PHP is similar to overriding methods. You define a property in the subclass with the same name as the property in the superclass.

### Example 2

```php
class ParentClass {
    public $property = "Parent property";

    public function displayProperty() {
        echo $this->property;
    }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    public $property = "Child property";
}

$child = new ChildClass();
$child->displayProperty(); // Outputs: Child property
```

## Conclusion

Overriding properties and methods in PHP allows for more flexible and reusable code. By understanding and utilizing these features, you can create more robust and maintainable applications.
